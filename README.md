# Operating-System-C-
# Project1
In this project, I implement the following functions: (1) In user mode, fork a child process to execute the test program. (2) When child process finish execution, the parent process will receive the SIGCHLD
signal by wait() function. (3) When program2.ko being initialized, create a kernel thread and run my_fork
function. (4) Within my_fork, fork a process to execute the test program. (5) The parent process will wait until child process terminates. (6) Print out the process id for both parent and child process. (7) Within this test program, it will raise signal. The signal could be caught and 
related message should be printed out in kernel log.
# Project2
In this project, I complete the multithread program to implement 
the game “Frog crosses river”.
# Project3
In this project, I simulate a mechanism of virtual memory via GPU's memory.
# Project4
In this project, I implement a mechanism of file system
management via GPU's memory.
# Project5
In this project, I make a prime device in Linux, and implement file operations in kernel module to control this device.
